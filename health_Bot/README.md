# 🩺 Health Bot

📘 **Health Bot** is a Python-based healthcare chatbot developed to demonstrate the application of conversational systems in the healthcare domain. The system is designed to process user input expressed in natural language and provide structured, context-aware responses related to general health information and common symptoms.

🎯 The primary objective of this project is to explore fundamental concepts of chatbot development, including text preprocessing, intent recognition, and rule-based response generation, within a healthcare-focused use case. The chatbot serves as an educational prototype illustrating how automated conversational agents can assist in disseminating health-related knowledge.

⚠️ This project is intended strictly for academic and learning purposes. It does not perform medical diagnosis, prescribe treatment, or replace professional healthcare consultation. The information provided by the chatbot should be considered informational and non-clinical in nature.
